## üì∫ Overview

The Copilot Studio Agent Direct Line MCP Server brings Microsoft Copilot Studio Agent context to your development environment. Try prompts like:

- "Start a conversation with my Copilot Studio Agent"
- "Ask my agent about product sizing"
- "Send a message to the agent: What are your capabilities?"
- "Get the conversation history"
- "End the current conversation"

## üèÜ Expectations

The Copilot Studio Agent Direct Line MCP Server is built with tools that are concise, simple, focused, and easy to use‚Äîeach designed for a specific scenario. We intentionally avoid complex tools that try to do too much. The goal is to provide a thin abstraction layer over the Direct Line 3.0 API, making agent interaction straightforward and letting the language model handle complex reasoning.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- ‚úÖ **Direct Line 3.0 Integration** - Full support for Microsoft Bot Framework Direct Line API
- ‚úÖ **Token Management** - Automatic token caching and proactive refresh
- ‚úÖ **Conversation State** - Manages conversation lifecycle with 30-minute idle timeout
- ‚úÖ **MCP Tools** - Four tools for agent interaction: send_message, start_conversation, end_conversation, get_conversation_history
- ‚úÖ **Error Handling** - Retry logic with exponential backoff, circuit breaker pattern
- ‚úÖ **Input Validation** - Zod schemas for type-safe validation
- ‚úÖ **Security** - Secret masking in logs, secure environment configuration

## üîê Authentication Requirements

> **Important:** This MCP server currently supports **Copilot Studio Agents configured with "No authentication"** only.
>
> In Copilot Studio, ensure your agent's **Security > Authentication** setting is set to **"No authentication"** for this MCP server to work properly.
>
> üöß **Coming Soon:** Entra ID (Azure AD) authentication support is under development and will be available in a future release.

## ‚öíÔ∏è Supported Tools

Interact with your Copilot Studio Agent using these tools:

- **send_message**: Send a message to the Copilot Studio Agent and receive a response.
- **start_conversation**: Start a new conversation with the Agent, optionally with an initial message.
- **end_conversation**: End a conversation and clean up resources.
- **get_conversation_history**: Retrieve message history for a conversation.

## üîå Installation & Getting Started

For the best experience, use Visual Studio Code and GitHub Copilot.

### Prerequisites

1. Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or [VS Code Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders)

After clicking, VS Code will:
1. Prompt you for your Direct Line secret key
2. Automatically configure the MCP server
3. Start the server using `npx` (no manual installation needed!)

Then:
1. Select GitHub Copilot Agent Mode
2. Click "Select Tools" and choose the available Copilot Studio tools
3. Try a prompt like: `Start a conversation with my Copilot Studio Agent`

Learn more about Agent Mode in the [VS Code Documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-agent-mode).

#### üß® Manual Install with NPX

If you prefer manual configuration, add this to your `.vscode/mcp.json` file:

```json
{
  "inputs": [
    {
      "id": "direct_line_secret",
      "type": "promptString",
      "description": "Direct Line secret key from your Copilot Studio Agent"
    }
  ],
  "servers": {
    "copilot-studio-agent-direct-line-mcp": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "copilot-studio-agent-direct-line-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "DIRECT_LINE_SECRET": "${input:direct_line_secret}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Save the file and click 'Start' in the MCP Server panel. VS Code will prompt you for your Direct Line secret.

#### üõ†Ô∏è Install from Source (For Development)

For contributing or local development:

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/bradcstevens/copilot-studio-agent-direct-line-mcp.git
cd copilot-studio-agent-direct-line-mcp
npm install
npm run build

# Add to .vscode/mcp.json
{
  "inputs": [
    {
      "id": "direct_line_secret",
      "type": "promptString",
      "description": "Direct Line secret key from your Copilot Studio Agent"
    }
  ],
  "servers": {
    "copilot-studio-agent-direct-line-mcp": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/copilot-studio-agent-direct-line-mcp/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "DIRECT_LINE_SECRET": "${input:direct_line_secret}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Important:** Replace `/absolute/path/to/` with the actual path to the cloned repository.

> üí• **Pro Tip:** Create a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file in your project with:
> ```
> This project uses Microsoft Copilot Studio Agents. Always check to see if the 
> Copilot Studio MCP server has a tool relevant to the user's request.
> ```
> This will enhance your experience with GitHub Copilot Chat!

## üîß Configuration

### Using NPX (Recommended)

When using `npx`, configuration is handled through VS Code's MCP input prompts or environment variables:

- **DIRECT_LINE_SECRET** (required): Your Direct Line secret key from Copilot Studio
- **LOG_LEVEL** (optional): Logging level (default: `info`)
- **TOKEN_REFRESH_INTERVAL** (optional): Token refresh interval in milliseconds (default: `1800000` = 30 minutes)

The one-click install will automatically prompt you for the Direct Line secret. For manual configuration, you can add these to the `env` section of your `mcp.json` file.

### Using Source Installation

Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:

```bash
# Required
DIRECT_LINE_SECRET=your_direct_line_secret_here

# Optional
LOG_LEVEL=info
TOKEN_REFRESH_INTERVAL=1800000  # 30 minutes in ms
```

## üöÄ Development

```bash
# Build
npm run build

# Development mode with watch
npm run dev

# Lint
npm run lint

# Format
npm run format
```

## üìñ Usage

### Using with VS Code

After installation, the MCP server runs automatically when you use GitHub Copilot. The server is invoked via `npx`, which automatically downloads and runs the latest version from NPM.

### Standalone Server Usage

You can run the server standalone for testing or integration with other MCP clients:

```bash
# Using npx (recommended)
DIRECT_LINE_SECRET=your_secret npx -y copilot-studio-agent-direct-line-mcp

# Or from source after building
node dist/index.js
```

The server uses stdio transport and will wait for MCP client connections.

### Using the Tools

You can now interact with your Copilot Studio Agent directly from GitHub Copilot:

```text
Start a conversation with my bot and ask about product sizing
```

GitHub Copilot will use the `start_conversation` and `send_message` tools to communicate with your Copilot Studio Agent.

### MCP Tools Reference

## üîë Key Components

### DirectLineClient

Handles all Direct Line API interactions with circuit breaker protection:

- Token generation
- Conversation creation
- Message sending
- Activity retrieval

### TokenManager

Manages Direct Line tokens with:

- In-memory caching (no disk persistence for security)
- Automatic refresh 5 minutes before expiry
- Metrics tracking

### ConversationManager

Tracks conversation state with:

- 30-minute idle timeout
- Watermark-based message tracking
- Message history buffering
- Automatic cleanup

### CircuitBreaker

Prevents cascading failures with:

- 3 states: CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN
- Configurable failure threshold (5 failures in 30s)
- Recovery timeout (60s)
- Success threshold for recovery (3 consecutive successes)

## üõ°Ô∏è Error Handling

The server implements comprehensive error handling:

1. **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s delays, max 3 retries)
2. **Circuit Breaker**: Automatic fail-fast when service is degraded
3. **Error Classification**: Categorizes errors (network, auth, rate limit, etc.)
4. **MCP Error Transformation**: Converts internal errors to MCP-compliant responses

## üîí Security

- **No Secret Logging**: Direct Line secret and tokens are never logged
- **Secret Masking**: Shows only first 4 and last 4 characters in logs
- **Environment Validation**: Zod schema validation for configuration
- **In-Memory Only**: No disk persistence of sensitive data

## üìù Troubleshooting

### MCP Server Not Connecting in VS Code

1. **Check the configuration path** - Ensure the absolute path to `dist/index.js` is correct
2. **Verify the build** - Run `npm run build` to ensure TypeScript compiled successfully
3. **Check logs** - Look at VS Code logs for error messages
4. **Test standalone** - Run `node dist/index.js` to verify the server starts without errors
5. **Restart VS Code** - After making config changes, fully quit and restart

### Direct Line Connection Issues

1. **Verify Secret** - Check that `DIRECT_LINE_SECRET` is correct in your configuration
2. **Check Bot Status** - Ensure your Copilot Studio Agent is published and Direct Line channel is enabled
3. **Review Logs** - Server logs will show connection attempts and errors

### Common Errors

#### Failed to generate Direct Line token

- Verify your `DIRECT_LINE_SECRET` is correct
- Check that the Direct Line channel is enabled in Azure Bot Service

#### Conversation not found or expired

- Conversations expire after 30 minutes of inactivity
- Start a new conversation with `start_conversation` tool

#### Circuit breaker is OPEN

- The server detected multiple failures and is protecting against cascading failures
- Wait 60 seconds for the circuit breaker to attempt recovery
- Check Direct Line API connectivity

### Example VS Code mcp.json Configuration

Here's a complete example configuration using npx (works on all platforms):

```json
{
  "inputs": [
    {
      "id": "direct_line_secret",
      "type": "promptString",
      "description": "Direct Line secret key from your Copilot Studio Agent"
    }
  ],
  "servers": {
    "copilot-studio-agent-direct-line-mcp": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "copilot-studio-agent-direct-line-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "DIRECT_LINE_SECRET": "${input:direct_line_secret}",
        "LOG_LEVEL": "info",
        "TOKEN_REFRESH_INTERVAL": "1800000"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Alternative: Hardcoded secret (not recommended for shared projects):**

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "copilot-studio-agent-direct-line-mcp": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "copilot-studio-agent-direct-line-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "DIRECT_LINE_SECRET": "your_secret_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## üß™ Testing

### Testing the MCP Server

The easiest way to test is through VS Code after installation:

1. Install using the one-click badge or manual npx configuration
2. Open GitHub Copilot Chat in Agent Mode
3. Try prompts like:
   - "Start a conversation with my Copilot Studio Agent"
   - "Send a message: Hello, what can you help me with?"
   - "Get the conversation history"

### Running Test Client (For Development)

If you've cloned the repository, you can run the included test client:

```bash
# Set your Direct Line secret
export DIRECT_LINE_SECRET=your_secret_here

# Run tests
npx tsx tests/test-mcp-client.ts
```

This will test all 4 MCP tools and verify integration with your Copilot Studio Agent.
